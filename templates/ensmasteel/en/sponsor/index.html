                Developing robots for the Coupe de France de Robotique is an expensive and tim-consuming process. That's why we work with companies or any other entity interested in out projects.<br>
                <br>
                We usually provide <span style="color: #0b85c2;">publicity in exchange of financial support</span>. However, we are open to any proposal in order to satisfy your needs. More details can be found on this page, especially regarding our needs and the ways we can advertise.<br>

                <br>
                The knowledge we've acquired through our engineering training and personal projects means we'ere aiming for <span style="color: #af4507;">a good performance at the Coupe de France de Robotique</span>. Moreover, the ENSMASTEEL has been participating in this competition for a few years now, so we know exactly what to expect and how to prepare for it.<br>
                <br>
                We also thrive in <span style="color: #af4507;">improving our robot</span> by taking the best parts of previous years while innovating. For example, we plan on adding a camera this year in order to perform image recognition to spot all the entities on the game table (robots and elements).

                <span class="text title">What is the Coupe de France de Robotique or French Robotics Cup ?</span><br>
                <br>
                The french robotics cup is a competition of almost <span style="color: #e9890c;">200 teams</span> and has been organised for the past 20 years by the association Planète Science.<br>
                <br>
                Every Year the rules change which requires new robots and actuators. However, some things remain the same : <span style="color: #e9890c;">Every robot must be fully autonomous</span>, meaning it must have its own power source, actuators, sensors and intelligence, and all remote controls and external interventions are forbidden during the matches. Moreover, <span style="color: #e9890c;">robots have many constraints</span> such as a maximum size or active avoidance systems.<br>
                <br>
                This year, matches will take place on a 2x3 metres table and last 100 secondes. Each team has <span style="color: #e9890c;">one main robot</span> of a size smaller than 300x300x350mm and <span style="color: #e9890c;">and many secondary robots</span> whose size is smaller than a 10 cm cube.<br>
                <span style="color: #e9890c;">→</span> The main way to earn points is to build towers using the cylinders and planks prearranged at the center of the table.<br>
                <span style="color: #e9890c;">→</span> A secondary way to earn points is to occupy specific areas with the small robots.<br>
                One of the difficulties is that points and objects can be stolen by the opponent : there is a real work on strategy for this year.<br>

                    <span class="text">As previously mentioned, this year's robot builds on the strengths of previous years. Thus, this year's main robot features <span style="color: #109404;">the same propulsion as last year's</span>, given that the robot was fast and precise, while the main electronic board has also been retained for its reliability and modularity.</span>

                    <span class="text">Nevertheless, a <span style="color: #e74631;">complete overhaul of the secondary robots</span> is planned for this year to make them more competitive alongside the other teams. In fact, we had not focused our efforts on these robots, which were nonetheless vital last year. We will develop them with the goal of making them versatile so that they can be easily modified according to the regulations and preserved for several years.</span>

                    <span class="text">Up until this year, we were executing a sequence of actions without taking into account what was happening outside. This was a real problem, as our robot could go and find an element in one place when it was already moved to another : our robot wasn't taking into account the other robot's actions. But this year, we're planning on <span style="color: #2681e9;">adding a camera</span> in order to locate the elements and act according to their true position and not where they're supposed to be. <span style="color: #2681e9;">Our robot will be much more robust and reliable</span> and be able to cope with any situation.</span>

                <br>
                As any other team in the cup, we are allowed to promote companies with  <span style="color: #8383f8;">decals on our robot</span>. Furthermore, all of our team members will wear <span style="color: #8383f8;">ENSMASTEEL polo shirts</span> during the competition, so we can also display your logo on them.<br>
                <br>
                However, what makes the ENSMASTEEL stand out from many other teams is the fact that we are a club of the ISAE-ENSMA, an engineering school specialised in mechanics and aeronautics. Thus, we can <span style="color: #8383f8;">advertise your company within the school</span> itself. This advertisement will be seen by almost 900 engineering students and PhD students aged between 18 and 25.<br>
                <br>
                All of the above are only ideas, and we are also open to <span style="color: #8383f8;">your suggestions</span> !
